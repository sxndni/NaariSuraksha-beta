### üì± Testing Guidelines

#### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] **Mobile responsiveness** on various screen sizes
- [ ] **Emergency flows** work under stress
- [ ] **Location services** are accurate
- [ ] **Offline functionality** where applicable
- [ ] **Accessibility** for users with disabilities
- [ ] **Performance** on slower devices/networks

#### Emergency Scenario Testing
- [ ] **SOS activation** works quickly
- [ ] **Contact calling** functions properly
- [ ] **Location sharing** is accurate
- [ ] **Map services** load emergency locations
- [ ] **AI assistant** provides helpful responses

## üé® Design Contributions

### UI/UX Guidelines
- **Emergency-first design**: Critical features prominently displayed
- **High contrast**: Ensure visibility in various lighting conditions
- **Large touch targets**: Easy to use in stressful situations
- **Clear hierarchy**: Important actions stand out
- **Consistent patterns**: Familiar interactions across the app

### Design Assets
- Use the existing color palette (pink/purple gradient theme)
- Maintain consistent spacing (Tailwind's spacing scale)
- Icons should be from Lucide React library
- Ensure designs work on both light and dark themes

## üîí Security Considerations

### Privacy & Data Protection
- **Minimal data collection**: Only collect what's necessary for safety
- **Secure storage**: Use encrypted storage for sensitive data
- **Location privacy**: Clear controls over location sharing
- **Emergency override**: Safety features should override privacy when needed

### Code Security
- **Input validation**: Sanitize all user inputs
- **API security**: Secure all external API calls
- **Authentication**: Proper session management
- **Emergency access**: Ensure critical features work even if auth fails
